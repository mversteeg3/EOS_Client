# EOS_Client
This is a basic app that pulls the latest block from the blockchain and displays its contents to the user.  There is room for an expansion into a Ricardian rendering of the contract text in the data of the transaction actions, but sample data including non-empty ricardian contracts will be needed in order to complete this functionality.  Below are screenshots of the depiction of one block with transaction data and one without.
